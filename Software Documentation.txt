Purpose: This software uses the teleport API to retrieve
information about quality of life scores and salaries to
find the best numbers of both of the scores in a list
of all the urban areas registered there.

Challenge: Get all the information about scores and salaries,
make an index of them and get a list of the countries associated
with all these cities, and get the medium index of the countries and admin divisions
to make a graph. Make graph comparisons of 3 groups of two cities. In the graph 
presentation we are going to have a specific order, the order values
are going be stored in a table with comparisons id and order. 2 comparisons will
need to have the same of graph, and the other one will have to be different.


information needed: id | city | salary | scores | salary-score index | country | country medium index | AdminD 

tables(outdated):
- id | city | salary | score | salary-score index | id_admin | link (leisure , safety , business freedom , cost of living)

- id | adminD | adminD index | id_country

- id | country | country medium index

- id | id_city | id_city | order | id_graphType 

- id | graphType

OBSs:
- information should only repeat in the form of integers
- Salary info all in USD per year
